SBA 308A

This website follows the following requirement.
It uses the dog API. At the top of the page is a random picture of a dog, when you click on the picture, it changes to another picture. Below that is a dropdown menu where the user can  choose what type of image they would like to view on the page (GIF, picture, or a mixture of both) and an input box that allows the user to choose how many images they would like dispalyed on the page. The default is "all" and 15 images. 

Objectives:

- Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
- Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
- Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
- Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
- Organize files using modules and imports.

Requirements:

- Use the fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API. Use the data
provided by this API to populate your applicationâ€™s content and features.
20%
- Create user interaction with the API through a search feature, paginated gallery, or
similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data.
15%
- Enable user manipulation of data within the API through the use of POST, PUT, or
PATCH requests. Ensure your chosen API supports this feature before beginning.
15%
- Make use of Promises and async/await syntax as appropriate. 15%
- Organize your JavaScript code into at least three (3) different module files, and
import functions and data across files as necessary.
3%
- Ensure the program runs as expected, without any undesired behavior caused by
misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls
being handled out of order, etc.).
5%
- Create an engaging user experience through the use of HTML and CSS. 5%
Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work,
and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit). 10%
- Commit frequently to the git repository. 5%
- Include a README file that contains a description of your application. 2%
Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.
