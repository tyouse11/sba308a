SBA 308A

Objectives:

- Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
- Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
- Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
- Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
- Organize files using modules and imports.

Requirements:

- Use the fetch API or Axios to communicate with an external web API. Use the data
provided by this API to populate your application’s content and features.
20%
- Create user interaction with the API through a search feature, paginated gallery, or
similar. This feature should use GET requests to retrieve associated data.
15%
- Enable user manipulation of data within the API through the use of POST, PUT, or
PATCH requests. Ensure your chosen API supports this feature before beginning.
15%
- Make use of Promises and async/await syntax as appropriate. 15%
- Organize your JavaScript code into at least three (3) different module files, and
import functions and data across files as necessary.
3%
- Ensure the program runs as expected, without any undesired behavior caused by
misunderstanding of the JavaScript event loop (such as race conditions, API calls
being handled out of order, etc.).
5%
- Create an engaging user experience through the use of HTML and CSS. 5%
Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work,
and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit). 10%
- Commit frequently to the git repository. 5%
- Include a README file that contains a description of your application. 2%
Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.
